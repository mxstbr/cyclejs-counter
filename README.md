# Counter

A simple counter, written in Cycle.js and Typescript. Nothing fancy, just a small experiment for myself.

## Run yourself

To run this yourself, do the following steps:

1. Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/mxstbr/cyclejs-counter`

2. Setup the dependencies with `npm run setup`

3. Run the compilation with `npm run start`

Now you can open `index.html` in your browser and see the counter!
